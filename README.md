# SOLID, Design Patterns

## Single Responsability Principle
`There should never have more than one reason for a class to change`

A class should have a focused, single functionality or address a specific concern. Ideally, each responsability should be in a separete class.

## Open-Closed Principle
`Classes, Modules, Methods etc should be open for extension, but closed for modification`

We should be able to extend some functionality without changing the existing code
