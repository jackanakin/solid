# SOLID, Design Patterns

## 1 - Single Responsability Principle
`There should never have more than one reason for a class to change`

A class should have a focused, single functionality or address a specific concern. Ideally, each responsability should be in a separete class.

[Java Example](https://github.com/jackanakin/solid/tree/main/java/1%20-%20Single%20Responsability%20Principle)

## 2 - Open-Closed Principle
`Classes, Modules, Methods etc should be open for extension, but closed for modification`

We should be able to extend some functionality without changing the existing code

[Java Example](https://github.com/jackanakin/solid/tree/main/java/2%20-%20Open-Closed%20Principle)

## 3 - Liskov Substitution Principle
`We should be able to substitute base class objects with child class objects and this should not change the behavior of the program`

Subclasses should behave the same way as the objects of our superclass (Square Rectangle Example)

[Java Example](https://github.com/jackanakin/solid/tree/main/java/3%20-%20Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle)

## 4 - Interface Segregation Principle
`Classes should not depend on interfaces that they do not use (Interface Pollution: Large interfaces, unrelated methods)`

`Signs: classes have empty methods implementations, throw NotImplementedException(or similar) or return null default/dummies values`

[Java Example](https://github.com/jackanakin/solid/tree/main/java/4%20-%20Interface%20Segregation%20Principle)

## 5 - Dependency Inversion Principle
`High level modules should not deppend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstraction`

`Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions`

Example: Spring @Autowire annotation

[Java Example](https://github.com/jackanakin/solid/tree/main/java/5%20-%20Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle)

## 6 - Creational Design Patterns
`Deal with the creation of objects of classes`

### 6.1 Builder 
`Usefull when there is a complex process to construct an object, also, abstracts logic related to the object and allows immutable class creation`
